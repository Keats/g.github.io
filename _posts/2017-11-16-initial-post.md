title: "Gutenberg tutorial being written in... Jekyll"
date: 2017-11-16

Since I'm learning Gutenberg and writing tutorials at the same time so I'll have some docs to refer to later, 
I'm having to write my Gutenberg tutorials in GitHub Pages, which means Jekyll! Getting plenty of help from 
Jonathan McGlone's [Creating and Hosting a PersonalSiteon GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).
