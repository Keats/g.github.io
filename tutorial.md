# Gutenberg Tutorial: Using the Gutenberg static website generator

[Gutenberg](https://getgutenberg.io) lets you create high-performance websites quickly. 
It converts text files using a simple formatting language known as Markdown or [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) 
into HTML files via the command line. The finished site is pure HTML and therefore it is likely to be much faster
than similar websites created using WordPress.

Here are reasons both for and against using Gutenberg.

## Gutenberg Pros

* The websites Gutenberg creates are normally small and very fast
* Once you know how to use the toolchain, Gutenberg lets you generate sites quickly
* You can automate the creation and maintenance of websites
* You only need a single executable file
* Has [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/guide) built in (no external programs are run) so
maintaining style sheets is easier, especially on big projects
* Excellent community. Gutenberg's creator, [Vincent Prouillet](https://github.com/Keats), is responsive and tolerates
dumb questions with patie ce

## Gutenberg Cons

* It's a command-line utility. You pretty much have to be a programmer/devops person to 
use Gutenberg. Installing it, which means downloading a single file and copying it to a directory,
is marginally harder then just clicking an installer.
